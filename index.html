Every month the women would huddle in a friend's apartment to share sexist job frustrations and trade tips for how best to tackle them. Once upon a time, you might have called them a consciousness-raising group. But the problems of today's working world are more subtle, less pronounced, harder to identify - and harder to prove - than those of their foremothers. These women weren't just there to vent. They needed battle tactics. And so the fight club was born. </p> <p>Hard hitting and entertaining, <i>Feminist Fight Club</i> blends personal stories with research, statistics, and no-bullsh*t expert advice. Bennett offers a new vocabulary for the sexist workplace archetypes women encounter every day - such as the Manterrupter, who talks over female colleagues in meetings, or the Himitator, who appropriates their ideas - and provides practical hacks for navigating other gender landmines in today's working world. With Feminist Mad Libs, a Negotiation Cheat Sheet, and fascinating historical research, <i>Feminist Fight Club</i> tackles both the external (sexist) and internal (self-sabotaging) behaviors that plague women in the workplace - as well as the system that perpetuates them. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your Library section along with the audio.</b></p>","title":"Feminist Fight Club: An Office Survival Manual for a Sexist Workplace","titleShort":"Feminist Fight Club"},{"added":22,"asin":"B00VAZVUD0","authors":[{"name":"Gene Kim","url":"B00AERCJ9E"},{"name":"Kevin Behr","url":"B001JS6SXU"},{"name":"George Spafford","url":"B0034PJ7UC"}],"blurb":"Bill, an IT manager at Parts Unlimited, has been tasked with taking on a project critical to the future of the business, code named Phoenix Project....","categories":null,"cover":"51Fi5Fq4u5L","format":"Ungekürztes Hörbuch","language":"English","length":"14 Std. 46 Min.","narrators":[{"name":"Chris Ruen"}],"progress":0,"publishers":[{"name":"IT Revolution Press"}],"ratings":807,"releaseDate":"2015-04-07","sample":"https://samples.audible.de/bk/acx0/032985/bk_acx0_032985_sample.mp3","series":null,"summary":"<p>Five years after this sleeper hit took on the world of IT and flipped it on its head, the fifth anniversary edition of <i>The Phoenix Project</i> continues to guide IT in the DevOps revolution.

He tells it like it is - a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</i> is his antidote to the coddling, let's-all-feel-good mind-set that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.&nbsp;</p> <p>Manson makes the argument, backed by both academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited - \"not everybody can be extraordinary; there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault\". Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are only so many things we can give a f*ck about, so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</i> is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.&nbsp;</p>","title":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life","titleShort":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck"},{"added":5,"asin":"B07L9C99H5","authors":[{"name":"Neil Gaiman","url":"B000AQ01G2"},{"name":"Terry Pratchett","url":"B000AQ0NN8"}],"blurb":"The world will end on Saturday.
